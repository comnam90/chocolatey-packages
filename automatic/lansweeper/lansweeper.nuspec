    <description><![CDATA[[![Chocolatey](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/dt/lansweeper?logo=chocolatey)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/lansweeper)

IT Asset Management Software That Finds & Manages All Assets Across Your Enterprise. Track Hardware, Software, and Users. Agentless Network Discovery.

Lansweeper allows you to scan networks ranging from just a few to hundreds of thousands of assets.

## Features

* Get a complete and detailed inventory of your IT assets wherever they are located: on premises, cloud instances or mobile endpoints.â€‹
* Go beyond the massive amount of asset information Lansweeper retrieves by default and get a complete and up-to-date asset inventory.
* Choose from over 400 ready-made, out-of-the-box reports or build custom reports within minutes. Set up dashboards for a birds-eye view on your IT.

## Package parameters

The following parameters can be used:

* `/parts`: to specify which components to install (e.g. /parts ="SCAN,DB,WEB").
* `/dbserver`: SQLLocalDB or SQLServer (e.g. /dbserver="SQLServer").
* `/dbinstance`: to choose the SQL Server instance to connect to (e.g. /dbinstance="localhost\sqlexpress").
* `/dbuser`: to specify the database username that creates the database during installation.
* `/dbpassword`: to specify the database password of the user that creates the database during installation.
* `/dbuserconfig`: optional password for the lansweeperuser database user, useful when installing multiple scanning servers.
* `/allowdboverwrite`: forces the installer to overwrite an existing database found during a new Lansweeper installation.
* `/webserver`: IIS or IISExpress.
* `/httpport`: to specify the web console's HTTP port (e.g. httpport=81).
* `/httpsport`: to specify the web console's HTTPS port (e.g. httpsport=82).
* `/folder`: to specify the Lansweeper installation folder.
* `/credkeyfile`: to specify the encryption key file (Encryption.txt) to be used.
* `/noDCOMReset`: to prevent the Lansweeper installer from making DCOM changes on the Lansweeper server.
* `/ConfigurationFile`: to perform the installation by pointing to a config file that contains the necessary parameters.

Example: `choco install lansweeper --params "/dbserver=sqlserver /dbinstance=localhost\sqlexpress /allowdboverwrite"`

All parameters and values are case-insensitive, except the values provided for /dbuserconfig and /dbpassword.  
If a specific parameter is not provided, a default value is assumed. For instance, if you don't specify which components to install, the assumption is made that you want to install all of them.  
If the installation stops unexpectedly, its log file can be found by typing %temp% in the path of Windows Explorer. The log file is a .txt and will start with "Setup Log...".  
The final installation log file can be also found in Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Install on your Lansweeper server once the installation has fully completed.

## Notes

* If the installer detects an existing installation of Lansweeper, it will attempt to upgrade it.
